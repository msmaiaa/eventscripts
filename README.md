# eventscripts
This extension adds some level of support for eventscripts language on .txt files.  

The commands were scraped from eventscript's [archived documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20171012105522/http://www.eventscripts.com/pages/Main_Page). Some metadata like syntax and params are missing from some commands because they're not available on the official documentation. Contributions are welcome!  

If you wish to disassociate eventscripts for .txt files, press CTRL + Shift + P and then search for "Change Language Mode", select "Configure file association for .txt" and then select PlainText. You can also go the other way around.

#### TODO:
- [ ] add support for wcs commands
